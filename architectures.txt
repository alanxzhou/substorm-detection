CNN on individual stations

todo
----
baseline
deal with missing data
	potentially just restrict our data to a set of stations with a lot of data and not a lot of missing values
	fill in our missing data
RNN on individual stations
Combining features

How to deal with missing data?
------------------------------
Which stations do we use?
	try all the stations?
How do we fill in missing values?
	0s?
tensorflow data api

How to combine features?
------------------------
threshold number of closest stations
deep sets
graph cnn
rnn (need an order)
attention (seems complicated and hard)
